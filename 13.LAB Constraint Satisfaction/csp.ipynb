    "# Constraint Satisfaction Problems\n",

    "broadly categorized as constraint-satisfaction problems (CSPs). CSPs are composed\n",
    "of variables with possible values that fall into ranges known as domains. Constraints\n",
    "between the variables must be satisfied in order for constraint-satisfaction problems\n",
    "to be solved. Those three core concepts—variables, domains, and constraints—are\n",
    "simple to understand, and their generality underlies the wide applicability of\n",
    "constraint-satisfaction problem solving.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider an example problem. Suppose you are trying to schedule a Friday\n",
    "meeting for Joe, Mary, and Sue. Sue has to be at the meeting with at least one other\n",
    "person. For this scheduling problem, the three people—Joe, Mary, and Sue—may\n",
    "be the variables. The domain for each variable may be their respective hours of\n",
    "availability. For instance, the variable Mary has the domain 2 p.m., 3 p.m., and\n",
    "4 p.m. This problem also has two constraints. One is that Sue has to be at the meeting. The other is that at least two people must attend the meeting. A constraint satisfaction problem solver will be provided with the three variables, three domains,and two constraints, and it will then solve the problem without having the user\n",
