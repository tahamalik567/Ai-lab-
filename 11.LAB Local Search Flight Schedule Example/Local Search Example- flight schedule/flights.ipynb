    "The algorithm version of annealing begins with a random solution to the problem. It\n",

    "gets lower. In each iteration, one of the numbers in the solution is randomly chosen\n",
    "and changed in a certain direction. In our example, Seymourâ€™s return flight might be\n",
    "moved from the second of the day to the third. The cost is calculated before and after\n",
    "the change, and the costs are compared.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hereâ€™s the important part: if the new cost is lower, the new solution becomes the\n",
